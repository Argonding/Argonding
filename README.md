## Hi, there!
This is Argonding! Nice to meet you here~🙌

Now I am an undergraduate student from School of Earth and Space Sciences at Peking University, and am interested in **photography**, **natural scenery**, and **birds**.
My photography works👉https://500px.com.cn/Argondinghome

My academic interests are **sedimentary petrology** and **paleontology**, especially the shell structure and habitat paleoenvironment of **brachiopods**. 🐚(But note that this is not actually a brachiopod!!)
